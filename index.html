            Technical documentation refers to any document that explains the
            use, functionality, creation, or architecture of a product. Think of
            it as a nuts-and-bolts “how to” guide for your users, new hires,
            administrators, and anyone else who needs to know how your product
            works.
          </p>
          <p>
            Technical documentation isn’t just about capturing information. It’s
            about presenting it in a way that’s easy to read, usable, and
            actually helpful for your audience. So if you don’t know where to
            start, here’s our short guide to making technical documentation
            that’s actually helpful.

            JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted,
            object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best
            known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many
            non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based,
            multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports
            object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to
            design / program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an
            event. JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting
            language, widely used for controlling web page behavior.

            JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to
            implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does
            more than just sit there and display static information for you to
            look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps,
            animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can
            bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of
            the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and
            CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the
            Learning Area.

            React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library
            for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from
            small and isolated pieces of code called “components”. React has a
            few different kinds of components, but we’ll start with
            React.Component subclasses:
          </p>
          <code
            >ReactDOM.render(
            <h4>Hello, world!</h4>
            , document.getElementById('root') );</code
          >
          <br />
          <code>const user = { firstName: 'Harper', lastName: 'Perez' };</code>
          <p></p>
        </section>
        <br />
        <section class="main-section" id="Components">
          <header>Components</header>
          <p>
            Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the
            same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and
            return HTML. Components come in two types, Class components and
            Function components
          </p>
          <code
            >function Welcome(props) { return
            <h4>Hello, {props.name}</h4>
            ; }</code
          >
          <p></p>
        </section>
        <br />
        <section class="main-section" id="State">
          <header>State</header>
          <p>
            State management is simply a way to engender communication and
            sharing of data across components. It creates a concrete data
            structure to represent your app's State that you can read and write.
            ... When a user performs an action in a typical React app, changes
            occur in the component's state
          </p>
          <code
            >constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = {date: new Date()};
            }</code
          >
          <br />
          <code>this.state = {date: new Date()};</code>

            React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose
            declaratively with your application. Whether you want to have
            bookmarkable URLs for your web app or a composable way to navigate
            in React Native, React Router works wherever React is rendering
          </p>
          <code>
            import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route, Link } from
            "react-router-dom";</code
          >
